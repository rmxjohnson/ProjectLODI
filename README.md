# Project 2 - LODI (Let Other's Do It)

Brad Hersey, Steve Mazanec, Joe Wancho, Rhonda Johnson              

## Overview

LODI is an app used for local home contractors.  A contractor can add information to the database.  A customer can add reviews for a contractor.  When a review is added, the contractor's overall average rating is updated.

LODI uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a sequalized ORM.  The app follows the MVC design pattern.  Node and MySQL are to query and route data in the app.  Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.
